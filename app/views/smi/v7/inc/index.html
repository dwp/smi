      <ul class="list list-bullet changes mb1">
        <li>Moved the "short cut links" with </li>
        <li>Created a new fake profile to reflect the fake MI12 taking to Seaham. NINo is QF082262D. (<a href="search?nino=QF082262D">Start search with this profile</a>)
        <li>Changed order of the <a href="search-nino-found-start?nino=QF082262D">confirm details page</a> to match the MI12 to help users scan both sets of information, so now is Full name / National Insurance Number / Date of birth	/ Address	/ Qualifying benefit.</li>
      	<li>Look-up lender code on the enter a mortgage/loan page split into <a href="money-lookup?nino=QF082262D&newapplication=yes">an initial stage now</a>. User sees just the lender look-up, clicks button, and then sees the rest of the screen.</li>
        <li><a href="money?lendercode=5651&nino=QF082262D&newapplication=yes">Bank details pre-populated</a> represent accompanying MI12 form, so user feels they have entered that information into the prototype from the form.</li>
        <li>Moved <a href="limit_and_deductions">upper limits and deductions page</a> further along the user's journey. Now sits after they have entered mortage/loan information.</li>
        <li>Removed related notes from every screen. Assumption: an easy-to-read-for-users system generated log of notes would be more benenficial for consistency of messages and saving of time.</li>
        <li>Removed list of payments from the <a href="payments-list?nino=QF082262D">payments page</a> (commented out) to reflect journey for research session (no payments will have been set up yet).</li>
